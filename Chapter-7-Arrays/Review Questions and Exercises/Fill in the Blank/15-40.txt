15. The __size declarator__ indicates the number of elements, or values, an array can hold.
16. The size declarator must be a(n) __constant integer expression__ with a value greater than __zero__.
17. Each element of an array is accessed and indexed by a number known as a(n) __subscript__.
18. Subscript numbering in C++ always starts at __0__.
19. The number inside the brackets of an array definition is the __size declarator__, but the number inside an array’s brackets in an assignment statement, or any other statement that works with the contents of the array, is the __subscript__.
20. C++ has no array _________ checking, which means you can inadvertently store data past the end of an array.
21. Starting values for an array may be specified with a(n) _________ list.
22. If an array is partially initialized, the uninitialized elements will be set to _________.
23. If the size declarator of an array definition is omitted, C++ counts the number of items in the _________ to determine how large the array should be.
24. By using the same _________ for multiple arrays, you can build relationships between the data stored in the arrays.
25. You cannot use the _________ operator to copy data from one array to another in a single statement.
26. Any time the name of an array is used without brackets and a subscript, it is seen as _________.
27. To pass an array to a function, pass the _________ of the array.
28. A(n) _________ array is like several arrays of the same type put together.

30. To define a two-dimensional array, _________ size declarators are required.
31. When initializing a two-dimensional array, it helps to enclose each row’s initialization list in _________.
32. When a two-dimensional array is passed to a function the _________ size must be specified.
33. The ____________________ is a collection of programmer-defined data types and algo- rithms that you may use in your programs.
34. The two types of containers defined by the STL are ___________ and ______________.
35. The vector data type is a(n) ______________ container.
36. To define a vector in your program, you must #include the ____________ header file.
37. To store a value in a vector that does not have a starting size, or that is already full, use the ________________ member function.
38. To determine the number of elements in a vector, use the _____________ member function.
39. Use the ________________ member function to remove the last element from a vector.
40. To completely clear the contents of a vector, use the ___________ member function.
