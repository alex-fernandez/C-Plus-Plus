*	  019. BUDGET ANALYSIS
*
*       Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that 
*       he or she has budgeted for a month. A loop should then 
*       prompt the user to enter each of his or her expenses 
*       for the month and keep a running total. When the loop 
*       finishes, the program should display the amount that the 
*       user is over or under budget.
