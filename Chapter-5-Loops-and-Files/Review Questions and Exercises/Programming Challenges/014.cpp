*       014. Find as many errors as you can.
*
*       A teacher has asked all her students to line up single file
*       according to their first name. For example, in one class Amy
*       will be at the front of the line and Yolanda will be at the
*       end. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of
*       students in the class, then loops to read that many names.
*       Once all the names have been read it reports which
*       student would be at the front of the line and which one
*       would be at the end of the line. You may assume that no two
*       students have the same name.
*
*       Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 or
*                         greater than 25 for the number of
*                         students.
